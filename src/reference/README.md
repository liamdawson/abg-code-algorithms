# Reference

These are the original "reference" algorithms which are suspected to be compatible. They are not particularly human-friendly, but will remain here as a comparison and/or test suite.

There are three algorithm versions:

1. For 4-character game codes that end with letters `A` through `E`
2. For all other 4-character game codes
3. For all 5-character game codes

Note that the `web` module may override some of the results when used, based on observed behaviour.
